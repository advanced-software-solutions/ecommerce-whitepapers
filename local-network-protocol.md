## Executive Summary

Local Network Protocol is a network definition that is restricted to a certain geographical zone. This zone will not allow communication coming from the public internet and also the external calls to the public internet. The geographical zone will be located per country. These network zones are not connected directly and will not share or exchange data.

The goal is not to limit the application execution to the public internet. Instead we can allow the application to be safely executed and communicate within a restricted network that is under a country and will not expose the local user to the public internet or have it's data exchanged in the public internet for better performance and better privacy and security.
