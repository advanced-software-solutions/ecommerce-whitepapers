## Introduction

### The Challenge

Identity verification is either hard or can be done via others. You can send OTP SMS but if the phone is insecure then it does not allow safe handling of such measures. Also, every service/website/app needs to implement their verification mechanism and use providers. These providers do not use consistent method or define risk level or factors that they need to relay one. For example, for financial transactions they only use OTP via SMS. And they keep repeating the cycle for every transaction.

### Why This Matters

The identity is something very hard to confirm via an internet connection. The user can be anybody and the information can be faked and OTP and other methods like SMS are not secure way of communications. Although the mentioned methods are hard to penetrate there is still a high chance to not be able to confirm the identity.

This paper is trying to expand authentication and verification and provide a robust way to confirm the identity of the user doing the action. Not only limiting it to OTP method but expanding it and provide a secure connection and making sure the communication is secure and not being hacked or not the intended user is doing the action.
